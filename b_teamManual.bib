  abstract = {Learn how to reframe your time around life's happiest moments to build days that aren't just full but fulfilling with this ``joyful guide'' (Eve Rodsky, New York Times bestselling author) that is the antidote to overscheduling.Our most precious resource isn't money. It's time. We are allotted just twenty-four hours a day, and we live in a culture that keeps us feeling ``time poor.'' Since we can't add more hours to the day, how can we experience our lives as richer?  Based on her wildly popular MBA class at UCLA, Professor Cassie Holmes demonstrates how to immediately improve our lives by changing how we perceive and invest our time. Happier Hour provides empirically based insights and easy-to-implement tools that will allow you to:  -Optimally spend your hours and feel confident in those choices -Sidestep distractions -Create and savor moments of joy -Design your schedule with purpose -Look back on your years without regrets  Enlivened by Holmes's upbeat narrative and groundbreaking research, Happier Hour ``is filled with loads and loads of practical, evidence-based advice for how to live better by investing in what really matters. It's the kind of book that can change your life for the better'' (Laurie Santos, Yale professor and host of The Happiness Lab podcast).},
